# Tool Permission Requirements

When running these commands, always use the specified permissions:

- `gh` commands: Use `required_permissions: ["all"]` due to certificate requirements
- `npm/yarn/pnpm install`: Use `required_permissions: ["network"]`
- `git push/pull`: Use `required_permissions: ["network"]`
- `pip install`: Use `required_permissions: ["network"]`
- Authentication operations: Use `required_permissions: ["all"]`
- `source` and `pytest`: Use `required_permissions: ["all"]` to ensure test runs have access to .env and other critical configuration

# Troubleshooting

- If an operation fails with permission related errors, ask the user if you can run it with ["all"] permissions or outside the sandbox.
- If git or gh operations keep failing, ensure you are using ssh and not https connections in the project
