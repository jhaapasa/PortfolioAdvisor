## Documentation Creation and Organization
- **Planning and Design**: When creating multi-step plans or significant designs for features, improvements or optimization, always create a design document in docs/design
- **Implementation**: After implementing a feature or improvement, especially a significant one that had design documentation, always cerate an implementation notes document in docs/implementation.
- **User and Developer Documentation**: Only create user or developer documentation when asked to. Place these in the main docs/ folder, not in any subfolder.

## Documentation Updates
- Keep design documents up to date when iterating on the design
- Always check whether you need to update user or developer documentation when implementing features
- Always update implementation documentation when changing or further developing a feature, even if it is much later than the original documentation was created

## Documentation Style and Content
- Focus design documents on the "what" and the "why."
- Focus implementation documents on the "how."
- Include information on paths NOT taken for both design and implementation - and the reasons for it. This will help avoid going back and forth on key decisions.
- Include TODO items in implementation documentation as a list of possible future expansion or improvements.
